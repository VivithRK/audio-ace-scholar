Let's solve the addition problem, 57 plus 29, by stacking the numbers so that the tens and ones are lined up. The tens place is on the left, and the ones place is on the right. We start solving the addition equation by adding the numbers in the ones place. 7 plus 9 equals 16. In the number 16, there are 6 ones. Add 6 in the ones place. The 1 in 16 represents 10. We carry the 1 over to the tens place and write it above the 5, like this. Now we add the numbers in the tens place. 1 plus 5 equals 6. We need to add 2 more, which gives us 8. Write 8 in the tens place. The answer we found is 86. 57 plus 29 equals 86.
